<h3> Whats my Motivation ? </h3>

During my bachelor's degree, we had a courses like Database Management Systems (DBMS) and Advanced Database Management System, and it was during this course that my interest in data analysis developed. My professor explained the significance of data analysis in managing large volumes of data and deriving actionable insights from it. 

Specifically, he highlighted the need for data analysis in the context of the supermarket business, where vast amounts of data are generated daily through sales transactions, inventory records, customer information, and more. 

Understanding the role of data analysis in improving various aspects of supermarket operations, such as inventory management, pricing and promotion Optimization, customer satisfaction, fraud detection, loss prevention and profitability, intrigued me. It became clear to me that the ability to extract valuable information from complex datasets could drive informed decision-making and lead to significant business benefits.
